# PHP Datagrid

This is very simple datagrid library to accomplish need for mine personal projects. I will appreciate any feedback if you decide to use it.

## Main intent of this library

- Performance for database queries - There is no specific database dependency. I am using it mainly with relational databases.
- Easy way to extend it to specific data source
- Framework independent library - It's question of minutes to extend this library for specific framework.

## References

- I actually found funny to write this code after re-reading few tips from [Baron Schwartz](https://www.xaprb.com/) about performance for MySQL - [see this article](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3210905/10-essential-performance-tips-for-mysql.html).

## Notes

If someone decides to use it, ask me:

- To redesign this package for your framework. I decided to keep it in single package and not divide it package extensions for personal "pragmatical" reasons. Oh yeah! This lazy programmers... 

**Enjoy your coding!**
